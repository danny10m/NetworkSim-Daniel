Objective

The purpose of this lab was to understand basic network simulation using GNS3 in a virtual environment, create simple switch-based topologies, test connectivity, and document the results using GitHub for submission.

ENVIRONEMENT SETUP :-
Operating System Used : Windows OS
Simulation Software Used : GNS3 (GUI + Local server)
Devices Used: VPCS (virtual PCs), Ethernet switches
Version Control & Submission: GitHub (public repository)


PART A – GNS3 Installation
 

Part B – Network Topologies

Topology 1 –  Simple LAN

Devices :   2 VPCS , 1 Switch
Connected PCs through switch          
Assigning ip address to the vpcs (same subnetmask)
 
2.	Topology 2 – Star Topology
Devices used : 
	4 PCs, 1 Switch
	Central switch connected to all PCs
	 
Assigning ip address

3.	Topology 3 – Multi-Switch Mesh
	3 switches interconnected in loop
	1 PC per switch
 

All PCs assigned IPs in same subnet
Verified full end-to-end connectivity

 Part D – GitHub Submission

Created a public repository named:
